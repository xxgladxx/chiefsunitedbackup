![Artwork](https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs/blob/master/.github/RESSOURCES/BANNERS/Base_banner.png)

This is a Python package made for [Laggron's Dumb Cogs](https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs).

It is installed as a pip package and will be imported by the cogs. This prevents having to copy and paste the same code in each cog, having the tools in one place makes it easier for maintenance.

For more info (docs, contributing, contact), please check the Laggron's Dumb Cogs repository.

## Install

Type the following command in your console:

```
python3.8 -m pip install git+https://github.com/retke/Laggron-utils.git
```
